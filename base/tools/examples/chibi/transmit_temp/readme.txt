This example will read the temperature sensor once every 5 seconds
and broadcast the data.  Once the temperature has been read, the
board will go into deep sleep (normally consuming <25uA on the
LPC1114 802.15.4 Wireless Sensor Board).  

This simple example shows an easy way to send sensor readings using
battery power for a period of several years.
